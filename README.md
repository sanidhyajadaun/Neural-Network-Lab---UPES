# Neural-Network-Lab-UPES

This repository contains the Lab work that I have performed in the course Neural Network at UPES.

#

Experiment No 1- Introduction to Python <br>

Explored the tools with different options like <br>
- Python installation <br>
- Numpy array creation and manipulation<br>
- Plots using matplotlib<br>

#

Experiment No 2- Introduction to Pytorch<br>
- Automatic differentiation
- Dataset creation
- Data loader

#

Experiment No 3- Building neural networks from scratch.

#

Experiment No 4- Building a single layer perceptron without using any framework

#

Experiment No 5- Implementation of Convolution neural networks <br>
- Demonstrate the implementation Conv, Pool, Activation, Fully connected layers

#

Experiment No 6-Implementation of RNN
- Program to demonstrate text classification using RNN

#

Experiment No 7- Implementation LSTM
- Program to demonstrate sentiment classification using LSTM
